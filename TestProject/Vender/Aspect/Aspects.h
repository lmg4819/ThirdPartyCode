  Aspects uses Objective-C message forwarding to hook into messages. This will create some overhead. Don't add aspects to methods that are called a lot. Aspects is meant for view/controller code that is not called a 1000 times per second.
 
  Adding aspects returns an opaque token which can be used to deregister again. All calls are thread safe.
